# Speech-to-Text Transcription Project

## Project Overview

This project leverages various speech-to-text models and data processing techniques to perform transcription services. It aims to convert spoken audio into text with high accuracy, addressing challenges such as noise reduction, accent variability, and homophone detection.

## Key Features

1. **Data Preparation:**

   * Utilizes `librosa` and `noisereduce` for loading audio files, removing silence, and normalizing audio signals.
   * Supports uploading audio data via Google Colab.

2. **Model Integration:**

   * Uses transformers from Hugging Face for model deployment.
   * Integrates with OpenAI Whisper (optional) for enhanced transcription accuracy.

3. **Data Analysis:**

   * Analyzes accent distribution and identifies potential transcription errors.
   * Generates spectrograms to visualize noise and audio patterns.

4. **Performance Metrics:**

   * Computes **Word Error Rate (WER)** using the `jiwer` library.
   * Visualizes WER and error trends using `matplotlib`.

5. **Homophone Analysis:**

   * Detects and visualizes common homophones that could cause transcription errors.

## Installation

Run the following commands to install the required libraries:

```
!pip install kaggle transformers torchaudio librosa noisereduce
!pip install openai-whisper  # Optional
!pip install datasets
```

## How to Run

1. Upload your audio files using the Google Colab file upload feature.
2. Follow the Jupyter Notebook cells step by step to clean, analyze, and transcribe audio data.
3. View the results of WER calculations and homophone analysis through visualizations.

## Applications

* Automated transcription for interviews, podcasts, and call center recordings.
* Accent analysis for linguistic research.
* Homophone detection to improve transcription accuracy.
